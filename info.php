                    China alerted the WHO to cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan on December 31. COVID-19 is thought to have originated in a seafood market where wildlife was sold illegally. On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal to humans through illegally trafficked pangolins, prized in Asia for food and medicine. Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources. COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes appear to be more vulnerable. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people. The coronavirus family causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). They circulate in animals and some can be transmitted between animals and humans. Several coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The new coronavirus, the seventh known to affect humans, has been named COVID-19. Around 1 in every 5 people who are infected with COVID-19 develop difficulty in breathing and require hospital care. People who are aged over 60 years, and people who have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease or hypertension are among those who are at greater risk. Recent research evaluated the survival of the COVID-19 virus on different surfaces and reported that the virus can remain viable for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, up to four hours on copper, and up to 24 hours on cardboard. This research was conducted under laboratory conditions and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.

                    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better. Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off. Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. Stay home if you feel unwell. Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs. Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people. Avoid gatherings such as meals, gatherings in religious places, social functions etc...Do Not Spit or shout in public places to avoid the spread of droplets.  Do not touch your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands.  Ensure that the surfaces and objects are regularly cleaned. Avoid close contact with anyone with flu, cough and cold symptoms. Regularly clean phones, light switches, taps and doorknobs with disinfectants. Consult a doctor if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Well, if the person shows signs of cough, cold, shortness of breath and fever, it is advised that you seek immediate medical help by rushing him/her to the nearest hospital. It is recommended that you continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing ways to fight the virus. This is the simplest way to prevent COVID from spreading. All you need to do is stay inside your homes, practice hygiene and stay away from social gatherings. Quarantine can get interesting if you keep yourself busy. It’s the best time to concentrate on yourself and learn new things such as cooking, gardening, playing a new musical instrument etc. Simple, do what you love doing. Most scientists and researchers around the world claim that it takes minimum 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to be planned, tested and mass used. Staying indoors can do a lot better than you can ever imagine. Until a vaccine is devised we can’t expect a lot of our lives to get as it used to be. Simple precautions such as staying indoors, maintaining distance from people and practising hygiene will save you till we figure out a cure. Stay indoors, Stay Healthy!

                    At first, the new virus was called SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the researchers of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it SARS-CoV-2 virus as it has been found to be similar to the one which caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the significant microorganisms of rising respiratory infection. Corna virus are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. They can cause illness in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases like MERS and SARS. SARS have most likely begun from bats and afterwards moving into other mammalian hosts, for example, the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and dromedary camel for MERS-CoV - before jumping to humans.CoVs are positive-stranded RNA viruses with a crown-like structure when observed in the electron microscope, because of the presence of spike glycoproteins on envelope. There are 4 major categories of coronavirus: Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV), Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Deltacoronavirus (-CoV), and Gamma Coronavirus (ƴ-CoV). Only α and β coronaviruses able to infecting mammals/humans and as per genomic characterization it was revealed that bats and rodents are the gene sources of α-CoVs and β-CoVs. Avian species are found to be the gene sources of δ-CoVs and ƴ-CoVs and they tend to infect birds.7 human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified till date: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (causes severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and now SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-CoVs category. It is generally of round/elliptic or pleomorphic shape, with diameter ≈ 60-140 nm. It is also sensitive to UV light and heat, like other CoVs. The inactivation temperature of SARS-CoV-2 is about 27° C. On the contrary, it may also resist the cold below 0°C. Further, it can be inactivated by lipid solvents like ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform except for chlorhexidine. It was discovered that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to a bat CoV RaTG13, whereas it shares 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV. Based on this virus genome sequencing results & evolutionary analysis, bat is suspected to be a natural host of this virus origination, and SARS-CoV-2 might have been transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts to infect humans.
